Welcome!

This application exists to enable users to improve the quality of the music similarity results generated by <a href="https://www.heliosmusic.io">Helios</a>. Your feedback can become new knowledge for the AI that it can subsequently use to improve its internal algorithms.

It is highly recommended that you are some place quiet, with good quality headphones or speakers, and with a fast internet connection.

The way this is going to work is you will be presented with a series of randomly selected songs from your Helios server's catalogue. Each song will be used as a <i>search key</i> to retrieve other similar matches as discovered by Helios. A "search key" here is an actual piece of music and not words. The matches will be arranged in a <i>ranked</i> list.

A "ranked list" is a list of candidate matches ranked based on their apparent order of similarity to the search key - or at least as Helios best knew how. The first match is supposed to be the most similar to the search key while the last should be the least similar.

But Helios will not always get it right and that is where you come in. Your job as a music expert is to listen to each search key and its candidate matches. You will then decide whether the ordering of the matches Helios came up with was appropriate. For example, if you think the third match was more similar than the first, rearrange their ordering as you see fit.

What matters here is the <i>relative</i> ordering of the matches and <i>not</i> their degree of similarity to the search key. For instance suppose the search key was a jazz song. The first four matches returned were very similar and already in the correct order - but the fifth match was heavy metal and is not even remotely similar to the search key. You would in that scenario already have the matches in the correct order.

If you are unsure about any particular match you can remove it from the list of matches. There is no harm in doing this. Alternatively, you can also skip any search key.

You can take as much or as little time as you like with your training session. When you have had enough select File -> End Session. You will be given an opportunity to save your training data to resume later or to submit it to a system administrator for subsequent analysis by the Helios server.

Good luck!
